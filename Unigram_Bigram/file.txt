The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
The fox is quick, and the fox is clever.  
The dog watches the fox as the fox jumps high.  
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  
To be or not to be, that is the question.  
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.  
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.  
The path of success is the path of learning.  
The fox and the dog run together in the wild.  
The fox is not just quick but also clever and sharp.  
The dog and the fox play under the bright sun.
